DropboxCLI is a command-line tool for interfacing with Dropbox.

Usage: DropboxCLI -[ald] <path>
    -a <email> <password>               Authenticate.  This only needs to be done once, or when changing users.  The token is stored on disk in local settings (on Linux, ~/Settings)
    -l <path>                  Get metadata info at <path> (returns JSON object, see the Dropbox API documentation for a schema)
    -d <path>      Download file at <path>
    -c             List the email address that's been authenticated against
